# HuMomentInvariants

It’s a robust method that would be one that’s invariant to noise rotation and scale. It doesn’t always work and usually damage has to be very well segmented to get decent results.
there are seven invariants to detect shapes vs. Moments of 7 invariants have been computed with HUcomputemoments.m. Moments given as input in Huinvariant to Hueta. Like in parallel seven lines, ” η” values computed in HUeta.
